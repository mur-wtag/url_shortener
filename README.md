# Shortener

It's a simple url shortener RoR application

## Instruction
Simply setup database and Run rails server. I believe you could easy find out what have to do.

 - Guest users are only allowed to created short url, not authorized to view url analytics

**Nothing is permanent, specifically deletion of shorten code :p**
